# TODO:

- Add Features: Implement "Delete Thread" or "Markdown Rendering" (for code blocks).
- Style: Replace our simple Buttons with shadcn/ui (as you asked earlier!).
- Implement "New Chat" logic (currently just an alert).
- Add "Delete Thread" functionality.
- Switch to shadcn/ui for polished components.

# DONE

- Refactor: Split App.tsx into Sidebar.tsx, ChatThread.tsx, and Input.tsx.
